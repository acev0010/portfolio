**How it was made**

This portfolio was made from scratch using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 

The wireframes were created in Adobe XD and all of them went through the UI & UX process. Grids and layout choices were used to enhance the UX of the website, and a lot of design thought helped to create the final product. In addition, I utilized my own images and drew all the drawings exclusively for this website. 

**Challenges during development**

During the development part of this webpage, one of my biggest challenges was to use Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a tool that can be helpful to save time and make my website responsive, but in return, I had to learn and read how all the tags work. I was able to overcome this issue on the second day thanks to training. I used different tags and tried my best to use Bootstrap everywhere, that way I would learn as much as possible.

Another important obstacle was to match the contact page with my mockup. I realized it didn't work as well on the webpage as I expected, so I took the decision to try different bootstrap styles until I was satisfied with something (that's the reason why the contact page is not the same as the mockup).

Thanks to this project I am able to write and produce faster and efficiently. I learned a lot about bootstrap and the importance of making web pages accessible and responsive for everyone.

**Adittional notes**

The reason why the ''see more'' on the portfolio page doesn't work is because I don't have enough work I want to show yet. The button was added for future convenience.
